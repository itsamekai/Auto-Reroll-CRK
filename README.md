# Steps to Use
1) Turn on CRK with GPG.
2) Go to beascuit reroll page. 
3) Make sure all warning pop ups are gone. (>= 2 rolls, initial roll warnings)
4) Select lines needed (>= lines) & roll type. 
5) Press ESC to stop.

## Troubleshooting
1) If unable to detect the reset button, rescale your resolution to 1920x1080.
2) If unable to detect high rolls (i.e. constantly 0 high values), restart GPG.
3) If rolls are being read wrongly, try making use of the delay. (i.e "Cooldown" being read as "Coldown")
4) DM me on discord or @ me on discord.gg/creamery for other issues.

## TO DO
* Choose high roll values, i.e. yellow only rolls. (default is purple.)
* Allow reroller to stop when rolling multiple of other same rolls, if its of high value.
* Add support for other emulators. (primarily LD.)
* Read Numbers (not that important, but nice to have?)
* ~~refactor UI out of main for better clarity~~
* ~~Improve runtime per roll - needs more optimisation atm~~
    * current reads at 1.3s~ (seems like this can't be cut down due to the glare when rerolling)
    * current OCR takes <0.1s to read.
* Add more emulator support. 
* ~~Add support for tainted biscuits.~~
* ~~Add support for other elemental rolls.~~
* ~~Check positional values to ensure that n number of rolls matches the roll we _actually_ want.~~ 

## Development

1. Create a venv and install the requirements:
```
bash
py -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. run main.py to launch UI.
```
py main.py
```
